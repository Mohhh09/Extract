            </h2>
            <p>
                The Self Employment Tax Credit (SETC) is a specialized tax credit designed to provide support to self-employed individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. It acknowledges the unique challenges faced by those who work for themselves, especially during times of illness, caregiving responsibilities, quarantine, and related circumstances. This credit can be a valuable resource for eligible individuals to help bridge financial gaps caused by the unforeseen disruptions. The Self Employment Tax Credit (SETC) is not a loan but a retroactive tax credit of your 2020 or 2021 income taxes and will be sent directly to you by the IRS by way of the US Treasury, in the form of a check or ACH deposit. Any SETC credits sent directly to you can be spent however you would like, and never need to be paid back. It applied to those who Identify as a Self-employed Individual. A few examples, but not limited to, include:
            </p>
        
            <ul>
                <li>Rideshare, food, or product delivery drivers</li>
                <li>Freelance Workers</li>
                <li>Those earning an income via e-commerce sites like eBay, Etsy, Amazon, etc.</li>
                <li>Owning and operating a Freelance Business where you provide services to another company but are not directly employed by them.</li>

                  <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>The Sick and family Leave tax credit for self-employed and 1099 workers is for eligible self-employed individuals or independent contractors. <br>

                    Under the FFCRA, eligible self-employed individuals or independent contractors could claim a refundable tax credit against their income tax liability for up to 100% of the qualified sick and family leave equivalent amounts, subject to certain limitations, if they were unable to work or telework due to COVID-19-related reasons. <br>
                        
                    The qualified sick leave equivalent amount was the lesser of either $511 per day or 100% of the average daily self-employment income for each day an individual was unable to work or telework because they were subject to a quarantine or isolation order, had COVID-19 symptoms and were seeking a medical diagnosis, or were caring for someone who was subject to a quarantine or isolation order or who had COVID-19 symptoms. <br>
                        
                    The qualified family leave equivalent amount was the lesser of either $200 per day or 67% of the average daily self-employment income for each day an individual was unable to work or telework because they needed to care for a child whose school or place of care was closed due to COVID-19. <br>
                        
                    To claim the tax credit, eligible self-employed individuals or independent contractors would report the qualified sick and family leave equivalent amounts on their 2019, 2020 or 2021 tax return, depending on when the leave was taken.

                        There are a few factors that go into calculating your tax credit refund amount. The biggest factors would be: <br>
                        Your net income from your schedule C on your 2019, 2020 and 2021 tax returns. <br>
                        How many days you were out sick or told to quarantine with Covid-19 <br>
                        How long you might have cared for a loved one affected by Covid-19. <br>
                        How long any schools or daycare centers were closed (and you were forced to care for a minor child during the closings). <br>
